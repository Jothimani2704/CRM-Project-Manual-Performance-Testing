# Manual Testing Process
We meticulously planned our manual testing process, from test case creation to execution and defect tracking. This systematic approach allowed us to identify and rectify issues efficiently, contributing to the overall reliability and usability of the CRM application.

# Test Cases and Scenarios
We developed comprehensive test cases and scenarios covering various functional aspects of the CRM application, including user authentication, data entry, workflow processes, and integration with external systems. These test cases served as a blueprint for our testing efforts, ensuring thorough coverage of all system functionalities.

# Jira Integration
The integration of Jira into our manual testing workflow streamlined test case management, issue tracking, and collaboration among team members. By leveraging Jira's capabilities, we effectively communicated, assigned tasks, and monitored progress throughout the testing phase, enhancing overall efficiency and productivity.

# Conclusion
Our manual testing experience significantly contributed to the quality and reliability of the CRM project. By uncovering defects, validating user requirements, and ensuring adherence to quality standards, we played a vital role in delivering a software solution that meets the needs and expectations of our users.

# Performance Testing 
# Overview
This section presents the findings and methodologies from performance testing conducted on both the API server-side and Web Assembly (WASM) front end of our CRM project. Using industry-standard tools such as JMeter and BlazeMeter, we meticulously evaluated system performance under various loads and scenarios. The purpose of these tests was to ensure optimal user experience and system stability by identifying potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

# API Server-side Performance Testing
We meticulously assessed the server's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under varying loads and concurrent user interactions. The performance testing on the API server-side provided valuable insights into system efficiency and scalability.

# WASM Front-end Performance Testing
We evaluated the rendering speed, client-side processing efficiency, and overall responsiveness of the user interface through performance testing on the WASM front end. This assessment helped optimize user experience and identify areas for improvement in front-end performance.

# Methodology
Detailed methodologies, tools used, test scenarios created, and metrics measured during the performance testing phase are outlined in this section. Our approach ensured comprehensive and accurate assessments of system performance.

# Results and Conclusion
Statistical data, graphs, and analysis of system performance across different scenarios and usage patterns are presented in the results section. We summarize our findings, highlight areas of improvement, and draw conclusions based on the performance testing outcomes.
