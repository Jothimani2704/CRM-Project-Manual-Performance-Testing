# API Server-side Performance Testing
In this section, we detail the performance testing conducted on the API server side of our CRM project. This involved assessing the server's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under varying loads and concurrent user interactions.

# WASM Front-end Performance Testing
Here, we outline the performance testing carried out on the Web Assembly (WASM) front-end of our CRM application. This included evaluating the rendering speed, client-side processing efficiency, and overall responsiveness of the user interface.

# Methodology
We describe the methodologies employed during the performance testing phase, including the tools used, test scenarios created, and metrics measured. This section provides insights into the approach taken to ensure comprehensive and accurate performance assessments.

# Results
In this section, we present the results obtained from the performance testing exercises. This includes statistical data, graphs, and analysis of system performance across different scenarios and usage patterns.

# Conclusion
We summarize our findings and draw conclusions based on the performance testing outcomes. This section highlights any areas of improvement identified, as well as strengths and weaknesses observed in the system's performance.
